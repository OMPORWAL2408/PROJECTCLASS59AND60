        <p> > Hello! I am Om Porwal. My favourite hobby is reading books.Let it be any book, it will always give you information and morales which you need to know. Few of my favourite books are the harry Potter series, books written by Roald Dahl, Enid Blyton, Ruskin Bond, Rudyard Kipling, Katherine Applegate, J.K Rowling and many more. I have been reading books since I was barely 5 years old. It has also helped me to consume my sparse time in Lockdown. When school would be over, I would be very exhilarated and elated to read my engrossing books. An hour of reading would seem like just 2 mins! Reading books are exciting, humerous, fun, happiness, suspension. Reading books are a good source of improving vocabulary, writing skills, entertainment and a help to consume sparse time.
